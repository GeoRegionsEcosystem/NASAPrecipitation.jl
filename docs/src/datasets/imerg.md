# GPM IMERG Datasets

GPM IMERG Datasets are represented by the `IMERGDataset` AbstractType, which in itself is broken into the `IMERGHalfHourly`, `IMERGDaily` and `IMERGMonthly` Types.  For half-hourly and daily datsets, NASA provides not just the output from the final processing run, but also early and late near real-time runs.
